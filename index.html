          <h2>Hello</h2>
          <p>I'm an ambitious and motivated person who can adapt to new environments. You can view me as a team player with a strong work ethic and commitment to task completion. I can work in fast-paced environments and operate efficiently under tight pressure while juggling multiple projects with minimal supervision. I love music and sports.</p>

            <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
            <p>I am very proficient in Java as it was one of the main programming languages we focused on in my university. I've used Python, C, C++, and Ruby a couple of times as part of my coursework. Though it wasn't as intensive as Java, I practice these other languages with several sites like LitCode and Codecademy. I learned and used JavaScript, SQL, and PHP during my final projects in university. I completed two projects that demonstrated my skills in these languages. I will attach a link to those projects later on.</p>

            <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
            <p>I am well-versed in and familiar with the majority of Git procedures. It came in handy for both school and personal tasks. During my final school project, I learned MySQL. Before that, I had a solid understanding of how databases function and how to construct SQL database commands. For a school assignment, I also used Android Studio.</p>

            <h3>Frameworks and Libraries</h3>
            <p>I learned and used jQuery, Express.js, Node.js, JUnit5, and Phaser.io during my final project in school. It was an intense learning experience, followed by practical use of these frameworks and libraries. Links to these projects will be attached later on. I furthered my knowledge in web design by enrolling in a web design course on Udemy, where I learned more about React.js, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Mongoose, RESTful API, and many other tools.</p>
